kamoii's replica ReplaceDom then UpdateDom (all are Frame)
ctx give call to Syn, which is a Syn IO.
But I can't get conn early, conn is in attachSessionWithWebsocket
HTML becomes Frame.

websocketApp
  withSession
    attachSessionWithWebsocket
     frameLoop (conn out) & eventLoop (conn in)

backendApp
  preRender
    firstStep
      stepLoop (by Syn or Concur monad, unblock) & fireLoop (by event)
