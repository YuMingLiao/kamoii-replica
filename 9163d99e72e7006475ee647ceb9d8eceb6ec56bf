kamoii's replica ReplaceDom then UpdateDom (all are Frame)
ctx give call to Syn, which is a Syn IO.
But I can't get conn early, conn is in attachSessionWithWebsocket
HTML becomes Frame.

websocketApp
  withSession
    attachSessionWithWebsocket
     frameLoop (conn out) & eventLoop (conn in)

backendApp
  preRender
    firstStep
      stepLoop (by Syn or Concur monad, unblock) & fireLoop (by event)

`steppedBy` means this frame is stepped by (1) client-side event or (2) server-side event. new frame won't be created until old frame is stepped by either of them.

fireLoop use TMVar stepedBy to see if stepLoop is stillBlocking, can it be implemented in syncrhon?
